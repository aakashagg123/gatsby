# The Ten Principles of Process Automation

The conceptual spine of the Flowable track. Every lesson's Concept beat links back to
one of these. Read this first — it is the whole course at PM/architect altitude. The
phases then make you build each idea.

---

## 1. A process is a graph; execution is tokens moving through it

Strip away the notation. A BPMN model is a directed graph. Nodes — events, tasks,
gateways — connect through sequence flows. Executing a process means placing a
**token** on the start event and moving it along the edges until every token
reaches an end event. Parallel branches create multiple tokens. Joining means
waiting for tokens to merge.

If you can predict where the tokens are, you can predict everything the engine
does. That is why Phase 1 makes you build the token model before touching Flowable.

## 2. The diagram is the code

The BPMN XML you deploy *is* the executable artifact, not documentation of it.
This is the core bet of BPM engines: business stakeholders, product managers,
and engineers look at the same picture, and that picture is what runs. When the
diagram and the behaviour can't drift apart, a whole class of "the spec says X
but the code does Y" disputes disappears. Your audit conversation becomes "here
is the model, here is every instance's path through it."

The cost: you must model honestly. A diagram that hides the real logic in code
underneath it is worse than no diagram.

## 3. The engine is a state machine with a database

A process engine's superpower is not running things — it is **stopping**. A loan
application waits three days for a document. A token sits at a user task for a
week. The engine saves the token's position and variables to relational tables,
frees every thread, and survives restarts, deploys, and crashes. Execution
resumes exactly where it stopped, possibly on another node.

Everything else — clustering, failover, audit — falls out of this one design
decision: **state lives in the database, not in memory**.

## 4. Wait states define transaction boundaries

The engine advances tokens synchronously until it hits a **wait state** (a user
task, timer, message catch, or async continuation), then it commits. Everything
between two wait states is one ACID transaction. If a service task throws, the
token rolls back to the previous wait state, not to some arbitrary midpoint.

This is the single most misunderstood behaviour in BPM engines. When you know
where the transaction boundaries are, incidents stop being mysterious. When you
don't, "the process re-executed my payment call" becomes a production war
story. Phase 2 covers this in full.

## 5. Time is a first-class citizen

"Remind the customer in 3 days." "Expire the offer after 30 days." "Escalate if
not approved within 4 hours." In ordinary code these become cron jobs,
scheduler tables, and drift. In a process engine they are **timer events**:
declared in the model, stored as jobs, fired by the job executor, visible in
the diagram, and versioned with the process.

If your domain has deadlines, SLAs, or expiries, this is usually the feature
that pays for the engine.

## 6. Separate the flow from the work

The process model orchestrates; it should not *implement*. Service tasks
delegate to your domain services. User tasks delegate to humans. Decision
tasks delegate to DMN tables. The engine owns sequencing, state, retries, and
time. Your code owns business logic. When a model starts collecting scripts
and inline expressions full of domain rules, the boundary has leaked. You now
have logic that is neither testable like code nor readable like a diagram.

## 7. Decisions are not processes — give rules their own home

"Which applications need manual review?" is not a flow; it is a **decision**.
Model it as a DMN decision table: rows the business can read, hit policies
that make conflicts explicit, and changes that don't require redeploying the
process. The process asks the question; the table answers it. Mixing rule
logic into gateway conditions scatters your policy across the diagram where
nobody can review it as a whole.

## 8. Not all work is a flowchart — but most of yours is

CMMN exists for genuinely unstructured work: a fraud investigation where the
case worker decides what happens next from a set of available activities. It
is powerful and rarely needed. Most "our process is too dynamic for BPMN"
claims dissolve into a BPMN model with a few event subprocesses. Reach for
CMMN only after BPMN has actually failed you, and be suspicious of anyone who
starts with it.

## 9. Long-running instances outlive their definitions

A mortgage process runs for months. You will deploy new versions while
thousands of instances are mid-flight. Engines default to the safe answer:
running instances keep their old definition, and new starts get the new one.
They also offer migration tooling for when old instances must move. Every
model change must answer one question: *what happens to the tokens currently
inside?* This is the process-engine equivalent of a database migration, and
it deserves the same discipline.

## 10. The engine is infrastructure — treat the decision like one

Adopting a process engine is an architecture decision, not a library import.
The honest checklist:

- **Use an engine** when you have long-running, stateful, auditable flows with humans,
  timers, and multiple systems involved — loan origination, KYC, claims, onboarding.
- **Use a state column and a queue** when the flow is short, fully automated, and
  changes rarely — an engine would be ceremony.
- **Use a durable-execution runtime** (Temporal and friends) when the audience is
  purely engineers, flows are code-first, and nobody needs the diagram.

Flowable's particular position: open-source, embeddable in your JVM process or
standalone over REST, all three engines (BPMN/CMMN/DMN) in one platform, with a
commercial layer (Flowable Work) above it. Phase 10 turns this principle into
concrete decision guides.

## Connects to other tracks

- [The method: deconstruct, challenge, reconstruct](../../first-principles/the-method.md) — decomposing a process into tokens and wait states is first-principles thinking applied.
- [Multi-agent systems & protocols](../../agentic-ai/multi-agent-and-protocols.md) — orchestration by a shared engine vs. by autonomous agents that coordinate.
