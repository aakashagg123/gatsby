# Flowable open source vs Flowable Work vs Camunda 8 vs Temporal

> **Motto** — After eleven phases you can evaluate engines by their internals, not
> their websites: ask each candidate the course's questions and the matrix fills
> itself.

*Part of Phase 10 — Architecture & product decisions. Concept lesson — no code
required. This is Phase 0, lesson 04's rematch, with everything you've built since.*

## The Problem

Phase 0's landscape gave you two axes for a cold start. Now you know what a wait
state costs, what migration risk feels like, and what the ops surface demands —
so the final comparison can be what real selections need: the same
course-derived question set put to all four serious candidates, with the answers
that survive a proof-of-concept. This is also the lesson to reread the day a
renewal, a Camunda 8 pitch, or a "should we move to Temporal" thread lands.

## The Concept

The course's seven questions, asked of all four:

| Course question | Flowable OSS | Flowable Work | Camunda 8 | Temporal |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Where do waits live?** (Ph. 2) | rows in your RDBMS | same | Zeebe's replicated log | event history in its cluster; workers replay code |
| **Human tasks & identity?** (Ph. 3) | native tasks, pools, forms; BYO UI | native + shipped task UIs | native + Tasklist app | DIY — activities + your own task store/UI |
| **Failure planes?** (Ph. 4) | BpmnError vs retries/dead letters, as taught | same | same model on Zeebe incidents | code-level: retries/compensation in workflow code; no business-error-on-diagram |
| **Decisions?** (Ph. 5) | DMN engine, independent deploys | + decision modeler UI | DMN supported | none — rules are code or an external service |
| **Time & correlation?** (Ph. 7) | timers/messages/event registry | same + UI | timers/messages native | first-class timers & signals in code — genuinely excellent |
| **In-flight versioning?** (Ph. 8) | pin + migrate, as taught | same + tooling | version pinning; migration tooling | workers must keep old code paths alive (patching/worker versioning) — the hardest part of Temporal at scale |
| **Ops surface?** (Ph. 9) | your probe on your DB | + admin UIs | Operate app; exporter pipeline for history | its own cluster metrics; history is replay fuel, not SQL |

Reading the columns like an owner:

1. **Flowable OSS vs Work is *only* the edges question** (10.04): same engines,
   same answers to every internals row — Work adds modelers, task/admin UIs,
   CMMN-heavy case UIs, and a vendor SLA. Decide by counting UI users, not by
   engine features.
2. **Camunda 8 is the same *language*, different *physics*.** BPMN semantics you
   know, but state moves from your RDBMS to Zeebe — Phase 2's and Phase 9's
   chapters get rewritten (exporters instead of ACT_HI_ SQL, platform ops
   instead of DB ops). Choose it for genuine throughput ceilings or its SaaS,
   not as "newer Camunda 7".
3. **Temporal's column is consistent, and consistently code.** Superb durable
   execution, real timers/signals — with humans, decisions, and diagrams as
   DIY. Its versioning row deserves special respect: "old code paths in workers
   forever" is Phase 8's problem *without* the migration tooling.
4. **The PoC that settles it** (two weeks, either finalist): the capstone.
   Parallel checks, an error-boundary fallback, a DMN decision, a timed offer,
   one migration mid-flight, and the Phase 9 probe pointed at it. Any candidate
   that makes those two weeks miserable has answered the evaluation.

## Ship It

This lesson ships
[`outputs/competitive-matrix.md`](../outputs/competitive-matrix.md) — the
seven-question matrix plus the PoC script, closing Phase 10 and the course's
concept track.

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** Flowable Work's differentiation over OSS is…

- A) a faster engine
- B) the human layer — modelers, task/admin UIs, SLA — on identical engines; it's 10.04's buy-the-edges decision
- C) exclusive DMN
- D) cloud only

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — every internals row matches OSS. Price the
UIs against building on Phase 3's clients.</details>

**Q2.** Migrating from Camunda 7-class engines to Camunda 8 is nontrivial mostly
because…

- A) BPMN files don't open
- B) the state substrate changes — RDBMS rows to Zeebe log — so embedding, transactions (Ph. 2), and the SQL-flavoured ops story (Ph. 9) all change with it
- C) licensing
- D) DMN was removed

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — same modelling language, different physics.
The diagram ports; your Phases 2 and 9 practices don't, unchanged.</details>

**Q3.** Temporal's hardest scale problem, in this course's vocabulary, is…

- A) throughput
- B) Phase 8 without the tooling — in-flight versioning means workers carrying old code paths (patch/version discipline) instead of pin-and-migrate
- C) timers
- D) retries

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — durable execution moves versioning from
engine feature to team discipline. Ask any large Temporal shop about workflow
patching.</details>

**Challenge.** Run the PoC script mentally against a *fifth* candidate — any
low-code/iPaaS workflow tool procurement suggests — and note which of the seven
questions it can't answer at all. That gap analysis, in an email, has ended more
bad evaluations than any matrix.
