# Build vs buy vs open source: the workflow TCO conversation

## The Problem

The build-vs-buy meeting is usually fought with the wrong numbers: license fees vs
"free", or sprint estimates vs sales decks. The real comparison is total cost of a
*capability* over five years — and the biggest line items are the ones this course
spent nine phases on: the state machine (Phase 2), retries and dead letters (4),
timers (7), versioning of in-flight work (8), and operations (9). Teams that
haven't named those items compare a visible license fee against an invisible
engineering mortgage — and the DIY option wins meetings it should lose.

## The Concept

Three options, priced over the same five columns:

| Cost line | DIY (status + queues) | Open source (Flowable OSS) | Buy (Work / competitors) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Core engine capability** (Phases 1–2, 4, 7, 8) | you build it — the full toy-engine syllabus, at production grade, forever | free, mature, 15-year lineage | included |
| **UIs** (modelers, inboxes, admin) | you build them | you build on the APIs (Phase 3 clients grow into this) | the actual product you're buying |
| **Operations** (Phase 9) | yours, plus the engine you wrote | yours — probe, retention, tuning, drills | reduced, not removed (their platform, your data) |
| **People** | senior eng, permanently — it's a product now | eng who've learned the engine (this course is the ramp) | fewer eng, plus vendor management |
| **Exit** | rewrite | migrate models to any BPMN engine (Phase 0.04's cell) | model portability minus proprietary UI/features |

The honest decision logic:

1. **DIY is a niche, not a default.** It wins only at Phase 0.01's low scores —
   short, automated, stable flows. Past that line, "build" means re-deriving
   Phases 2–9 under deadline pressure; the checklist below exists to make that
   mortgage visible in the meeting.
2. **Open source is a build decision in disguise — about the *edges*.** The
   engine is free and excellent; you are choosing to build UIs (Phase 3's
   clients → a real inbox), the ops practice (Phase 9), and to own upgrades.
   For a JVM product team with this course behind them, that's a known,
   bounded cost — often the right one in fintech, where the engine's DB rides
   your existing audit/residency story (Phase 0.04's axis).
3. **Buy when the bottleneck is the layer above the engine.** Many
   citizen-developer teams, heavy modeler usage, task UIs for hundreds of ops
   users, vendor SLA required by procurement — that's Work's actual product
   (10.01's third column). Buying an engine you'll only call over REST from
   your own UIs is paying for shelfware chrome.
4. **Count the option value of the standard.** BPMN/DMN artifacts outlive
   vendors: the capstone's XML deploys on Flowable today and Camunda tomorrow.
   DIY state machines and proprietary low-code flows have no such exit — price
   that asymmetry, especially at contract renewal time.

## Ship It

This lesson ships
[`outputs/tco-worksheet.md`](../outputs/tco-worksheet.md) — the five cost lines
as a fill-in worksheet, plus the DIY-mortgage checklist for the meeting where
someone says "how hard can a workflow engine be?"

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** The most commonly *omitted* cost in DIY estimates is…

- A) hosting
- B) the engine capabilities themselves — durable waits, retries, timers, migration of in-flight work, the ops surface (Phases 2–9, at production grade, forever)
- C) licenses
- D) training

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — the sprint estimate covers the happy path;
the mortgage is everything this course needed seven phases to even
*describe*.</details>

**Q2.** "Open source is free" is wrong because you're actually choosing…

- A) hidden license fees
- B) to build the edges — UIs, ops practice, upgrade ownership — around a free core; a bounded, known build if the team has the skills
- C) worse engines
- D) nothing; it is free

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — OSS shifts spend from license to
engineering, at the edges rather than the core. Whether that's the right trade
is a team-shape question.</details>

**Q3.** The strongest signal to *buy* is…

- A) the engine lacks features
- B) the constraint is above the engine: modeler-heavy business users, large ops-user task UIs, procurement-mandated vendor SLA
- C) budget surplus
- D) microservices

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — engines are commoditised by the standard;
the commercial products differentiate on the human layer. Buy where your
bottleneck actually is.</details>

**Challenge.** Fill the worksheet for the capstone platform three ways (DIY, OSS,
buy) with your organisation's real day-rates and team shape. Then write the
sentence that would change your answer — "we would switch from OSS to buy the
day ___" — because the trigger, not the snapshot, is what the annual review
needs.
