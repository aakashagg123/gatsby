# Backward-compatible model changes: a checklist

> **Motto** — Migration pain is chosen at *editing* time: model changes made with the
> pinned population in mind migrate for free; careless ones cost a mapping document
> each.

*Part of Phase 08 — Versioning & migration. Concept lesson — no code required.*

## The Problem

Phases 8.01–8.03 dealt with versions after the fact. But the cost of every future
migration is set earlier — in the modeler, the moment someone "tidies up" element
IDs, deletes a task that tokens might occupy, or renames a variable. Each of those
edits is invisible in review ("the diagram looks the same!") and turns the next
deploy from *drain quietly* into *migration project*. Teams need the same instinct
database engineers have about column renames — and it fits on one page.

## The Concept

Every edit sorts into three buckets by what it does to the pinned population and
lesson 02's auto-mapping:

| Bucket | Edits | Cost |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Safe** (auto-migrates, drain works) | add activities on new paths; add boundary events/event subprocesses; widen gateway conditions; change expressions, forms, assignments *on existing IDs*; add optional variables | none |
| **Mapping needed** | rename element IDs; replace a task with a different one; split one activity into two; move activities across subprocess boundaries | explicit `from → to` per edit, forever (until that population drains) |
| **Breaking** (mapping can't save you) | delete an activity tokens may occupy; remove a variable later steps read; repurpose a variable's meaning/type; narrow a gateway so old data matches nothing; remove the default flow | redesign the change, or accept stuck/misrouted instances |

The deeper rules behind the buckets:

1. **Element IDs are your ABI.** The diagram is the code (Principle 2), and IDs are
   its stable symbols — auto-mapping (8.02), history queries, timer re-seating all
   key on them. Rename labels freely; rename IDs never (cosmetic ID renames are the
   #1 self-inflicted migration).
2. **Variables are a schema without a migrator.** The engine maps *positions*, not
   data: a v5 step reading `employmentType` finds nothing in a v1-started instance
   that never wrote it. Every new read needs a default
   (`${employmentType ?? 'salaried'}`), a backfill, or a guard — exactly a nullable
   column with no `DEFAULT`.
3. **Additive beats mutative.** Need different behaviour at `review`? Add
   `reviewV2` on a new path and route to it — old tokens keep a valid home, new
   instances take the new road, and the old branch is deleted a quarter later when
   the population drains. Two small versions beat one clever one.
4. **Gateways must stay total for *old* data.** New conditions are evaluated
   against variables written under old versions; every exclusive gateway keeps a
   default flow, and conditions tolerate missing variables (Phase 1's dead-instance
   rule, now with a time dimension).

## Ship It

This lesson ships
[`outputs/model-compatibility-checklist.md`](../outputs/model-compatibility-checklist.md)
— the three buckets as a pre-merge checklist for model review, closing the phase:
versions (what a deploy does), migration (how tokens move), rollout (which cohorts),
and now compatibility (how to rarely need any of it).

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** Renaming a userTask's *label* vs its *ID*:

- A) both are cosmetic
- B) label is free; the ID rename converts every future migration of live tokens at that task into an explicit-mapping exercise
- C) both are breaking
- D) IDs can't be renamed

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — IDs are the migration contract and the history
key. Labels are for humans; IDs are for the engine.</details>

**Q2.** v6 adds a step reading `employmentType`, which pre-v6 instances never wrote.
Safe deployment requires…

- A) nothing — the engine defaults it
- B) a null-tolerant expression, a backfill of old instances, or a guarded path — a variable read is a schema dependency
- C) migrating everyone first
- D) deleting old instances

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — positions migrate, data doesn't. Treat new
variable reads like adding a NOT NULL column: supply the default
yourself.</details>

**Q3.** The team wants `review` to behave completely differently. The
lowest-total-cost edit is usually…

- A) rewrite `review` in place
- B) add `reviewV2` on a new path, route new instances to it, delete the old branch after the population drains
- C) delete `review` and migrate with mappings
- D) a new process key

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — additive-then-prune keeps every live token
housed and makes the eventual cleanup a safe deletion of an *empty*
branch.</details>

**Challenge.** Diff the capstone model against a hypothetical v2 that (a) renames
`creditReview` to `seniorCreditReview`, (b) adds a fraud-check service task before
the DMN call, and (c) starts reading a new `channel` variable at the route gateway.
Bucket each edit, write the mapping/default it demands, and state which cohort
strategy (8.03) the combined change forces. That's the whole phase in one exercise.
