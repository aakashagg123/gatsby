# Run Flowable locally: Docker, REST API, first ping

> **Motto** — One container, one base URL, one credential pair — everything this

*Part of Phase 00 — Orientation & setup. This is the phase's **Use It** lesson.*

## The Problem

Every Use It beat from Phase 1 onward assumes a running engine, and every "the
lesson doesn't work" report traces to one of three boring causes: the container
isn't running, the URL is wrong, or auth failed. This lesson pins the setup once
and ships the diagnostic that separates those causes in five seconds — the same
first-contact ritual you'll run against a *real* environment someday, where "is it
up, what's deployed, is anything stuck" are the opening moves of every incident.

## The Concept

The course's standard environment:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 flowable/flowable-rest
# REST base : http://localhost:8080/flowable-rest/service
# credentials: rest-admin / test
```

What that container is — and importantly, isn't:

| Property | Value | Consequence |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Engines | all four (BPMN/CMMN/DMN/event registry) + REST | every lesson's Use It works against it |
| Database | in-container H2 by default | **state dies with the container** — a feature for lessons, never production |
| Auth | HTTP Basic, one admin user | fine locally; a real deployment puts your API layer in front (Phase 3, lesson 03) |
| Custom Java | none — you can't add delegates | why course models use expressions/HTTP/DMN tasks (Phases 1, 4, 5) |

Two upgrades worth knowing exist, both deferred deliberately: pointing the
container at PostgreSQL (`FLOWABLE_DATASOURCE_*` env vars) makes state survive
container replacement — Phase 2 lesson 01's Use It uses exactly that property; and
the *embedded* topology (engine inside your Spring Boot app) is Phase 2 lesson 05
and the Phase 10 topology decision.

The REST surface follows one idiom everywhere, which is why a single ping script
generalises: `repository/*` for deployed artifacts, `runtime/*` for live state,
`management/*` for jobs and engine internals, `history/*` for the past, `query/*`
for rich filters. Learn the five prefixes and you can navigate any endpoint you
haven't met yet.

## Use It

[`code/ping.py`](../code/ping.py) runs first contact — reachability, auth,
deployments, live state — with each failure mode named:

```
$ python3 ping.py
engine  : default 7.0.x
deployed: 0 process definition(s)
open instances : 0
open tasks     : 0
dead letters   : 0

engine is ready — next: deploy something (Phase 1, lesson 04's flowable_client.py)
```

The zeros on a fresh container are the correct answer — and the same script run
mid-course doubles as a tiny health check (it's the ancestor of Phase 9's probe:
same queries, no thresholds). Kill the container and run it again to see the
unreachable branch; change the password to see the auth branch. Now you've seen
all three failure modes on purpose, before any lesson shows you one by accident.

## Ship It

This lesson ships [`code/ping.py`](../code/ping.py) — first-contact diagnostics
for any Flowable engine, local or remote.

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** You restart the default container and Phase 1's deployed model is gone.
This is…

- A) a bug
- B) the in-container H2 doing exactly what it does — state died with the container; use the PostgreSQL env vars when you want survival
- C) a licensing limit
- D) REST caching

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — ephemerality is the default's trade. Phase
2's persistence promise applies to the *database*, and this container's database
lives inside it.</details>

**Q2.** A colleague's script gets HTTP 401 against the container. The fix is…

- A) restart Docker
- B) credentials — the image speaks Basic auth as rest-admin/test; 401 means reachable-but-unauthenticated, a different failure from unreachable
- C) use port 8081
- D) disable auth

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — ping.py names the two branches separately
because conflating them wastes the first twenty minutes of every setup
session.</details>

**Q3.** Which REST prefix answers "what *could* run" vs "what *is* running"?

- A) runtime vs history
- B) repository vs runtime
- C) management vs query
- D) form vs task

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — repository holds deployed definitions (the
potential); runtime holds live instances (the actual). The other prefixes follow
the same one-word logic.</details>

**Challenge.** Point the container at a local PostgreSQL (official image docs list
the `FLOWABLE_DATASOURCE_*` variables), deploy Phase 1's model, destroy and
recreate the container, and run ping.py — the deployment count surviving is Phase
2, lesson 01's claim, verified with your own hands on day zero.
