# Chunking code without breaking it

> **Motto** — Split code on structure, not on line counts — a chunk should be a whole function.

*Part of Phase 13 — Retrieval & Codebase Understanding.*

## The Problem

To embed and retrieve code (lessons 02–03), you split files into chunks. Naive fixed-size
chunking ("every 50 lines") slices through the middle of functions, so a retrieved chunk is
half a function with no context — useless to embed and worse to hand the model. Code should
be chunked on **structural boundaries** (functions, classes) so each chunk is a coherent,
self-contained unit.

## The Concept

  F["source file"] --> P["parse (ast/tree-sitter)"] --> C["chunk per function/class"] --> E["embed coherent units"]
```

## Build It

`code/chunk.py` — split a Python file into function/class chunks via `ast`:

```python
import ast

def chunk_code(source):
    tree = ast.parse(source)
    lines = source.splitlines()
    chunks = []
    for node in tree.body:
        if isinstance(node, (ast.FunctionDef, ast.AsyncFunctionDef, ast.ClassDef)):
            start = node.lineno - 1
            end = getattr(node, "end_lineno", start + 1)
            chunks.append({"name": node.name, "lines": (node.lineno, end),
                           "code": "\n".join(lines[start:end])})
    return chunks
```

```python
src = ("import os\n\n"
       "def login(u):\n    return u\n\n"
       "class Session:\n    def open(self):\n        return True\n")
for c in chunk_code(src):
    print(c["name"], c["lines"])     # login (3,4) ; Session (6,8)
```

Each chunk is a complete definition with its line span — coherent to embed, and it carries
`path:line` so a retrieval hit links straight to the read tool (Phase 6).

## Use It

Code-aware chunking (via `ast` or, multi-language, tree-sitter from Phase 6) is what makes
code retrieval actually useful — retrieved units are whole functions, not fragments. For an
agent, this means "find code related to X" returns something it can read and edit directly.
Oversized definitions still need a secondary split, but the boundary stays structural.

## Ship It

[`code/chunk.py`](../../04-chunking/code/chunk.py) — structural (function/class) code chunking.

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** Why chunk code on structural boundaries instead of fixed line counts?

- A) it's faster
- B) fixed chunks slice through functions, producing incoherent fragments
- C) the OS requires it
- D) no reason

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — whole functions embed and retrieve far better.</details>

**Q2.** What should a code chunk carry alongside its text?

- A) nothing
- B) its name and `path:line` span so a hit links to the read tool
- C) the whole file
- D) a token count only

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — location for navigation.</details>

**Challenge.** Handle over-large functions by splitting them into sub-chunks (e.g. by inner
blocks) while keeping each labeled with the parent function name.
