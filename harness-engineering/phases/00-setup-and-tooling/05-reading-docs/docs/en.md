# Reading the Docs Like an Engineer

> **Motto** — The model knows a lot; the docs know what's true *today*.

*Part of Phase 00 — Setup & Tooling.*

## The Problem

Model APIs change: new parameters, new models, deprecations. An agent (or a learner) that
answers from training memory will confidently use a stale model id or a removed flag. The
fix is a habit — and a skill — that says *check the authoritative source before
answering*, rather than guessing.

## The Concept

Three moves separate guessing from engineering:

1. **Locate the source of truth** — official docs / SDK reference, not a blog.
2. **Verify specifics** — model ids, parameter names, limits — against it.
3. **Cite where it came from** — so the next reader can re-verify.

This is the human version of *legibility*: don't crawl everything; go straight to the
authoritative file and quote it.

## Build It

A skill that encodes the habit so any agent applies it. `outputs/SKILL.md` triggers on
LLM/API questions and forces a docs check before answering, defaulting to the latest
models (Fable 5; the Claude 4.x family — Opus 4.8 `claude-opus-4-8`, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku
4.5).

## Use It

Installed into Claude/Cursor/Codex, the skill activates on questions about model choice,
pricing, parameters, or limits and answers from the reference rather than memory — the
same discipline this whole course models.

## Ship It

[`outputs/SKILL.md`](../../05-reading-docs/outputs/SKILL.md) — a "check the docs first" skill
for any agent.

## Check Yourself

**Q1.** Why not answer model/API questions from memory?

- A) memory is slow
- B) APIs change; training can be stale, so verify against current docs
- C) it uses tokens
- D) you always can

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — correctness depends on what's true today, not at
training time.</details>

**Q2.** What does "cite where it came from" buy you?

- A) nothing
- B) the answer is re-verifiable by the next reader
- C) faster responses
- D) shorter prompts

<details><summary>Answer</summary>B — traceability; a claim you can check beats one you
must trust.</details>

**Challenge.** Add to the skill a short checklist it must satisfy before answering a
"which model should I use?" question (latest ids, context window, relative cost).
